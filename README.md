## Description
RewardBot was developed as part of the course project  for CS5704 - Software Engineering at Virginia Tech in Spring '23'. RewardBot is a smart bot-based reward and recognition system for software engineering teams. It solves the problem of existing rewards and recognition systems which suffer from multiple flaws, including a lack of transparency, difficulty in quantifying rewards, and poorly defined actionable objectives. RewadBot is a Slack bot that utilizes gamification principles to recognize and reward employees effectively. RewardBot awards points based on individualsâ€™ contributions to projects and their involvement in the open-source community. These accumulated points are displayed on a leaderboard and can be redeemed for various rewards, boosting employee motivation and fostering a healthy competitive environment.
